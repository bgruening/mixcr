                             Path to input files or directories.
                             In case of directory no filter by file type will be applied.
      [report.tsv]           Path where to write reports. Print in stdout if omitted.
      --with-upstreams       Export upstream reports for sources of steps with several inputs, like

                             Specify preset file of export fields
      --no-header            Don't print first header line, print only data
  -f, --force-overwrite      Force overwrite of output file(s).
      -nw, --no-warnings     Suppress all warning messages.
      --verbose              Verbose messages.
  -h, --help                 Show this help message and exit.
Possible fields to export
      -fileName              File name as it was specified in command `exportReportsTable`.

      -overlappedAndAligned  Percentage of overlapped and aligned reads.
      -alignmentsFailed      Percentage of reads that not aligned because of different reasons
                               (columns for each reason).
      -successAligned        Percentage of aligned reads.
      -readsWithChain        Percentage of reads aligned on specific chain. Will be exported all
                               found chains.

      -readsClusteredInCorrection
                             Reads pre-clustered due to the similar VJC-lists, percent of used.
      -droppedNoClonalSeq    Reads dropped due to the lack of a clone sequence, percent of total.
      -droppedShortSeq       Reads dropped due to a too short clonal sequence, percent of total.
