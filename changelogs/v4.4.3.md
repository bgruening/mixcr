# New features
- Export biochemical properties of gene regions with `-biochemicalProperty <property> <geneFeature>` export option.
  Available properties: Hydropathy, Charge, Polarity, Volume, Strength, MjEnergy, Kf1, Kf2, Kf3, Kf4, Kf5, Kf6, Kf7,
  Kf8, Kf9, Kf10, Rim, Surface, Turn, Alpha, Beta, Core, Disorder, N2Strength, N2Hydrophobicity, N2Volume, N2Surface.
- Added two commands for processing single cell data: `groupClones` and `exportCloneGroups`. First command will
  calculate `cellGroup` for each clone, second will export info about each group.
# Minor fixes
- Corrected the help message that appears when using a deprecated preset and incorrectly suggests using `--assemble-contigs-by` instead of `--assemble-clonotypes-by`.
- The `--split-by-sample` option is now set to `true` by default for all `align` presets, as well as all presets that inherit from it. This new default behavior applies unless it is directly overridden in the preset or with `--dont-split-by-sample` mix-in.
- Fixed possible crash with `--dry-run` option in `analyze`
- On `exportClone` and `exportShmTreesWithNodes` in case of splitting by tags, reads count of clones will be changed to
  the sum of reads for given tags selection

# New Presets
- `bd-sc-xcr-rhapsody-full-length-enhanced-bead-v2` new preset for BD full-length protocol with enhanced beads V2 featuring B384 whitelists.
