## ⚠️  Preset changes


- kAligner2 has been modified to work with both TCR and BCR data, the presets previously divided by the type of data now merged into one. Also, the division by `cdr3` and `full-length` presets has been deprecated; now the presets by default use the longest possible assembling feature according to the protocol:

- `qiaseq-human-tcr-cdr3` and `qiaseq-human-tcr-full-length` are deprecated and replaced by  `qiagen-human-rna-tcr-umi-qiaseq`. `qiagen-human-rna-tcr-umi-qiaseq` assemble clones by `{CDR2Begin:FR4End}` according to the manufactures read length recommendations.

- `qiaseq-mouse-tcr-cdr3` and `qiaseq-mouse-tcr-full-length` are deprecated and replaced by  `qiagen-mouse-rna-tcr-umi-qiaseq`. `qiagen-mouse-rna-tcr-umi-qiaseq` assemble clones by `{CDR2Begin:FR4End}` according to the manufactures read length recommendations.

- Parse bio preset `parse-bio-vdj-3gex` has been deprecated and raced by three presets according to the manufactures' kit options: `parsebio-sc-3gex-evercode-wt`, `parsebio-sc-3gex-evercode-wt-mini`, `parsebio-sc-3gex-evercode-wt-mega`. Now the presets include the whitelists for all CELL barcodes. CELL1, CELL2 and CELL3 now correspond to ParseBio Round 1, Round 2 and Round 3 (the order is reversed compared to the deprecated preset). Original Parse Bio cell barcodes naming has been added.

- Generic amplicon presets `generic-tcr-amplicon`, `generic-bcr-amplicon`, `generic-tcr-amplicon-umi` and `generic-bcr-amplicon-umi` are deprecated. New generic amplicon presets: `generic-amplicon` and `generic-amplicon-with-umi`
