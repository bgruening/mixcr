üêû This update addresses a significant issue that first appeared in version `4.3.0`, which caused incorrect column names for `FR4` nucleotide and amino acid sequences in export tables (e.g. `nSeqJGeneWithoutCDR3Part` instead of `nSeqFR4`).

## Minor improvements

- `findAlleles` now works much faster for extremely diverse samples

## Other bug fixes

- fixed inconsistency in reports and behaviour for `assemble` when `badQualityThreshold=0`
- fixes X axes label for k-mer filters in tags filtering QC plots
- adds threshold lines for tags filtering QC plots for composite operators (like operators with `cumtop` fallbacks)
- fixes NPE crash for chain usage plots if chimeric sequences present in the stats
