## Major features

- adds new `minSequenceCount` parameter for k-mer filter, allowing construction of more flexible filtering pipelines with better fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries
- added fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries for `10x-vdj-bcr` preset

## Minor features

- special mechanism to allow for NaN values in metrics in group filters (i.e. used in `minSequenceCount` parameter in k-mer filter)

## Bug fixes

- fixed inconsistency in report and behaviour in `assemble` when `badQualityThreshold=0`
- fixes X axis label for k-mer filters in tags filtering QC plots
- adds threshold lines for tags filtering QC plots for composite operators (like operators with cumtop fallbacks)
- fixes NPE crash for chain usage plots if chimeric sequences present in the stats
