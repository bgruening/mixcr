## Key changes

- implemented QC [TODO]
- new alignment
- special mechanism to allow for NaN values in metrics in group filters (i.e. used in `minSequenceCount` parameter in k-mer filter, see below)
- adds new `minSequenceCount` parameter for k-mer filter, allowing construction of more flexible filtering pipelines with better fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries

## Preset changes

- added fallback behaviour for under-sequenced libraries for `10x-vdj-bcr` preset

## Minor fixes and improvements

- added gene feature coverage in alignment report
- fix bug when `--chains` is used with `exportClonesOverlap`
- fix for `export...` - tag quality field added back to export columns
